	 <h4>Background story</h4>
  <p>Since 2021, Yvette has been assigning her students in the Information Design class at OSU to <a href="https://designviz.osu.edu/work/waste.html" target="_blank">spend one week collecting quantitative and qualitative data on their daily discarded waste and waste disposal methods</a>. The objective is to raise awareness about being mindful of how we use, discard, or waste mundane things in our lives.In Fall 2022, Joe assigned his students at North Dakota State the same task, allowing a comparison between the results from two groups of students in two different states. Surprisingly, the outcomes from both classes were remarkably similar. The most frequently discarded items in students' lives were food and packaging materials, with their primary focus on data collection being the materials they discarded. Despite the small sample size of student data, it prompts us to wonder whether it aligns with the waste patterns of the larger population and identifies the most wasted materials.</p>
	<p>The answer is a resounding yes, supported by the data on the EPA website. Therefore, we decided to present this information to the public in a more visually appealing and engaging manner.</p>
<li>The project’s <b>target audience is the general public.</b></li>
<li>The project’s <b>goal is to raise awareness about the overuse of materials in our consumer-driven society and to shed light on their impact on the environment.</b></li>
	
	<h4>Data selection</h4>
	<p>"Bloom" comprises three layers of data: 1. Proportions of materials in solid waste recorded by EPA; 2. Decomposition time for each material type; 3. The most common items in each material category. Our project goal prioritizes effective communication and engagement, avoiding unnecessary complexity. We believe a successful data "point of view" is not defined by its intricacy but by its clarity and viewer engagement. If complexity impedes understanding or connection for lay audiences, then the essence of the point of view is lost.</p>
	<p>To achieve our aim, we intend to use artistic and design methods that stimulate thought, provoke discussion, and raise awareness of environmental issues. Rather than catering to a small group of elites with specialized knowledge or aesthetic tastes, we find making important societal issues more understandable and relatable to everyone is a more meaningful pursuit.</p>

	<h4>Visual presentation</h4>
	<p>The flower motif was carefully chosen for this project because it directly parallels the progression of waste materials, from their use to their decomposition. Flowers are universally understood symbols with clear stages of growth, blossoming, wilting, and ultimately decomposing. This metaphor also suggests the contrasting beauty of nature, juxtaposed with the often ignored long-lasting environmental impact of waste, highlighting the discrepancy between appearance and reality in our consumerist society.</p>

<p>The use of flower forms to represent waste categories serves as a satirical comment on our consumerist society. Despite appearing as "flowers," these floral arrangements intricately consist of the most discarded items in each material category, based on our research. The deliberately chosen somber hues for the flowers and the overall project collectively invoke a surreal and intentionally melancholic reality.</p>

<p>The unpleasant reality of waste decomposition can often lead to apathy or avoidance. However, by using the captivating beauty of flowers and their lifecycle, our project aims to foster meaningful dialogue and raise awareness about the environmental impact of waste among the general public. This engagement strategy seeks to bridge the gap between the perception of consumed goods and their lasting effects on the environment, encouraging a more mindful approach to waste management.</p>
