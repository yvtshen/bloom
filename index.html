      <p>This project uses data published by the EPA to visually depict the material breakdown of America's 2018 municipal solid waste. Each constructed flower represents a specific material and its percentage in the waste composition. Through user interaction, corresponding objects descend, representing the decomposition timeframe for each material in the landfill.</p>
		<p>Juxtaposing the beauty of flowers with the harsh reality of waste production, this project urges us to reassess our lifestyles and consumption habits. It calls for individual adoption of sustainable practices while highlighting the urgent need for society to address material usage through systemic reformation. Together, we forge a path towards a better future for generations to come.</p>
