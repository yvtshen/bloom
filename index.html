      <p>This project uses data published by the EPA to visually depict the material breakdown of America's 2018 municipal solid waste. Each constructed flower represents a specific material and its percentage in the waste composition. Through user interaction, corresponding objects descend, representing the decomposition timeframe for each material in the landfill.</p>
		<p>By juxtaposing the inherent beauty of flowers with the harsh reality of waste production, the data design project strives to provoke collective contemplation and reassessment of our lifestyles and consumption habits, urging us to embrace sustainable practices for the well-being of future generations.</p>
